# Blocky TUI

This project is a [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) based terminal user interface (TUI) to query information and interact with the [blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky) DNS server.


## Current State
The project is archived, since I do not longer use the Blocky DNS server.

What is currently possible:
- have a functional TUI with navigation between different panes
- query DNS server health
- flush DNS cache
- update blocking list
